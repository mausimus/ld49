### Synopsis

Itâ€™s time for your annual retraining as an air traffic controller.

Can you still handle the pressure?

Try to pass a whole day of routing planes to avoid collisions in three different locations.

Controls:
* click plane to select, then click on map to re-route it
* use 1/2/3/4 to change game speed
* F for fullscreen (Windows only, use button on HTML5 version)

Written in C++ using raylib targeting Windows and HTML5. Also used Inkscape, sfxr, BeepBox and Audacity.

If you'd like to compile the code yourself install raylib 4.0 (with MinGW compiler if on Windows) and use make (or mingw32-make) to build.
